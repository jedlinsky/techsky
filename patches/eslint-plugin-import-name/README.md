# @techsky/eslint-plugin-import-name

`@techsky/eslint-plugin-import-name` enhances the original [eslint-plugin-import-name](https://github.com/R1ON/eslint-plugin-import-name) by introducing a feature to set suffixes for import names. This patched version allows for more flexible naming conventions, accommodating specific project requirements or coding standards.

## Warning

This package is a modified release of an established [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) plugin and has been specifically adapted for use within the `techsky` development framework. Potential integrators should review the suffix configuration feature to ensure it meets their coding guidelines and project standards before proceeding with integration.

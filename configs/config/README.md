# @e2js/config

The `@e2js/config` package serves as a convenient gateway within the `techsky` ecosystem, reexporting `@techsky/eslint-config`, `@techsky/tsconfig` and `@techsky/tsupconfig`. It streamlines the setup process by bundling these configurations together, making it easier to maintain and update project setups.

## Warning

`@e2js/config` is tailored for the `techsky` development environment and its continuous evolution. While it aims to provide convenience, users should be aware of its dependencies' development status and plan for production use accordingly.

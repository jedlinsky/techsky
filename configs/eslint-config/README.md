# @techsky/eslint-config

Part of the `techsky` monorepo, this package offers an in-depth [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration, currently positioned as a proof of concept. Designed for extensive linting in JavaScript and TypeScript environments, it sets the groundwork for high coding standards within the project.

## Status

This package is a work in progress and represents an initial approach to standardized linting and auto fixing configurations. An update to the [ESLint Flat Config](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/use/configure/configuration-files-new) format is planned to enhance flexibility and ease of use.

## Warning

`@techsky/eslint-config` is part of a project under active development and intended for personal experimentation. It is not recommended for production use at this stage, pending further updates and stabilization.

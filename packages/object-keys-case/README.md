# @techsky/object-keys-case

`@techsky/object-keys-case` is a utility designed to transform object property names into camelCase or snake_case. This package is a part of the `techsky` ecosystem, aimed at developers looking to standardize the casing of their object keys easily.

## Future Plans

The package is set to evolve by adding TypeScript type resolution, mirroring the runtime transformation. This feature will ensure type consistency across the project, enhancing developer experience by aligning compile-time type checks with runtime data structures.

## Warning

Currently in development, `@techsky/object-keys-case` is evolving towards more comprehensive functionality. While it offers valuable tools for handling object key transformations, users should be mindful of its integration into production environments, especially until the TypeScript type generation feature is fully implemented.
